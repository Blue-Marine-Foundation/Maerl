For each transect, they made 10 measurements (one per meter) using 50x50 cm quadrats to count the number of flowers within this area. Unfortunately, no flowers were found during these outings, indicating a sparse flowering density for 2024, but this will not impact our restoration efforts. 
Instead, this data has informed our planting strategy for the year, with a focus towards using seedlings and plant fragments for restoration. This remains an effective method in enhancing meadow resilience and expansion, especially in areas impacted by storms or anchoring. The team will also conduct further monitoring in the coming months to check for any changes in the plant's flowering state.

Quote from government response to REM consultation: 'We do plan to proceed with some of our proposals but others have changed as a result of the feedback received from the consultation'.

The original proposal was that two vessels would have mandatory REM by 2028. Following a strong push to make this proposal a lot more ambitious and faster, the current proposal now states that: 
'Remote electronic monitoring systems will begin to be implemented in all priority fisheries within the next five years. This will apply to all vessels over 10m in length active within those fisheries in English waters, including non-UK vessels. Once we are satisfied that implementation issues have been resolved for each priority fishery, we will then make it mandatory to have these systems installed. There will be two years notice given of that to allow vessels time to adapt and for installation to take place.'

The first priority fishery has already begun this implementation process and will have REM installed at a time well before the original consultation was proposing. Our input helped apply pressure and move the needle on this.

University of Exeter scientist, Dr Ben Harris, shared information about whales and the crucial role they (and their poo) play in the ocean’s carbon cycle. After working together to identify different whales from videos, the children made their favourite species of whale or squid using craft materials and explored the ocean through a virtual reality experience.
