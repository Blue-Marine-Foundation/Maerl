# Introduction

Maerl started life as an effort to scale Blue Marine Foundation's monitoring and evaluation (M&E) processes. Prior to 2023, Blue Marine Foundation used a spreadsheet-based system for monitoring and evaluating its projects. This system was time-consuming, prone to errors, often out of date, and it was not possible to track progress across different Impact Indicators.

## Monitoring and Evaluation at Blue Marine Foundation

Blue Marine Foundation's M&E system is an adaptation of the Darwin Initiative's 'Logical Framework' template, aka logframe. The logframe is a tool used to plan and monitor projects. It is a visual representation of the project's objectives, activities, outputs, and outcomes. The logframe is used to track progress and to evaluate the project's impact.

Separately, Blue Marine Foundation uses the Impact Indicators framework to centralise the measurement of the impact of its activities across multiple projects.

## Versions over time

As of December 2025, Maerl is in its third significant iteration.

**Version 1** recreated the spreadsheet-based system, but with a web interface and the ability to track progress across different Impact Indicators. It specifically allowed project managers to submit impact and process updates towards their predetermined logframe outputs.

**Version 2** included more project management features, helping directors build a birds-eye view of projects and their status.

**Version 3** allows logframes to be editable and to change over time.

## Tech Stack

Maerl is a Next.js, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS app using Supabase as the backend (database and authentication).
